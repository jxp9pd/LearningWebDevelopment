# LearningWebDevelopment


A collection of the small educational assignments I'm using to learn the basics of programming with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

MyInterests (Duke Webpage): Sample webpage utilizing basic HTML features: attaching links, images, structuring using div tags,
and separating between body and head. Links a CSS sheet adding some coloring to the text and modifies text-alignment of the headers.
